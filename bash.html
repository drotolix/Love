From the moment I met you, my world became <span class="word">brighter</span> and more beautiful. I just want to thank you for being there. The texts , the calls , I do miss them sometimes cuz your voice was literally the <span class="word">sweetest sound</span>,I've ever heard. But I just can't help it, maybe I feel too much or whatever. Just take care of yourself , that's more than enough for me. AND START EATING MORE else you'll die of starvation you idiot :|. I'm not gonna say more coz I really feel sleepy rn aur kal 9 baje se hi classes hai  , I'm working overnight tonight it's 3:57 am right now. I don't know if you'll like it or not but I just wanted to make you smile hehehehe...... JUST IN CASE YOU'RE LIKING IT, DON'T START BLUSHING LIKE A 16 YEAR OLD GIRL. YEA I DO LOVE YOU A LOT MORE THAN ME AND YOU CAN THINK OF IDK HAHHHHHHH.
