				You've been the best part of my life till date. Every moment with you feels like a precious gift, and I cherish the way we laugh, share, and support each other through life's ups and downs. Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your presence brings a sense of peace and warmth that words cannot fully capture. I admire you a lot and the way you make everything a better place just by being in it. You inspire me to be the best version of myself, and I am endlessly grateful for the connection we share. Our bond is my greatest treasure, and I am excited for all the adventures and memories that await us. With you, I've found a feeling that is pure, genuine, and unwavering, and I wish we stay like this for the rest of the time.

			Love
