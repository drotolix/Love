     Hey Rida !!!

       Just a quick note to let you know that you're amazing... and You mean so much to me. Not exaggerating but I find you perfect in every single manner. You're so cute that I'd spend my entire life by just looking at your prettyyyy face. Your eyes do have some spark in them cuz I just want to sink in them when I look at you. I can't write you irl letters , so I'm just giving it a try if it works for us hehehe!!! Never done that before tho. If anything's not good in here Don't blame me coz it's my first time. 
      <br>
      P.S. I love our little secret way to navigate around each other by using your URL like the command line.
